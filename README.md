# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of Project
From Alphabet Soup’s business team, We received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. I will use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results
### Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
USE_CASE—Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION—Organization type
STATUS—Active status
INCOME_AMT—Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
EIN and NAME

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Two hidden layers were used initially, 75 nodes were used in first hidden layer, 25 nodes were used in the second hidden layer.
Two different activation functions were used, one for the hidden layers and another for the output.

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


## Summary
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
